                <p>If there is one thing I'm enthusiastic about it is
                    Technology. From the internet to automated machines
                    Artificial Intelligence, I've always wanted to be 
                    part of every technological advancement.</p>

                <p>I'm  a curious person. I want to know every
                    little thing that makes every little thing 
                    works. I also long to help others understand
                    how stuff work. 

                    If you ever want me to get something done, Just tell me 
                    <strong>I can't do it.</strong>

                        <h3>My encounter with tech</h3>
                        <p>
                            My encounter with Technology (computer programming) is rather
                            epic. 
                            It all started during my senior class in highschool.<br />
                            Dad signed me as an apprentice with a computer technician.
                            I only go to him during holidays since I was always busy during
                            school sessions.<br /><br /> 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What we did then were to format and reinstall windows systems, install drivers and install packages.
                            We also troubleshoot motherboard and replace components that are <em> easily</em> replaceable.
                            We don't replace chips though. We rather tell the customers to 
                            buy a new motherboard when a chip has been damaged.<br />
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On a particular day while trying to make backup a customer's computer, my boss external HDD
                            got infected by virus. Each time he tried to open the hardrive, 
                            the virus would corrupt more files.<br />

                            I carefully watched my boss as he opened a black console and typed some
                            mysterious words. In awe I watched as file names and paths scrolled
                            up the screen.<br />

                            What is that? I asked my boss. <strong>CMD</strong> he mumble?
                            How does it work boss? I asked again. 
                            My boss never answered me. Maybe he would give me an answer when
                            I see him tomorrow I don't know.<br /><br />
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Determined to understand what my boss did, I went home, sat at the computer
                            and ran CMD. I stared at the black console with no idea at all. Then I started to type some
                            random stuff. Just when I was getting tired, I typed help. And for the 
                            first time, something meaningful came out.
                            
                            That night, I did my "file copy" operation on cmd before I went to bed.
                            And that is how it began. I would then borrow my dad's phone and 
                            search for more commands and usage until I came accross something called
                            batch scripting.<b /> <b />
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>MY FIRST BATCH SCRIPT LOOKS LIKE THIS:</strong> </p>
                        <div style = "padding-left:10px; text-align:left; background-color:black;color = white: width:100px; height:100px;">
                                top:<br />
                                   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp echo "hello world"<br />
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp pause<br />
                                goto top
                        </div>
                        <br /> <br />

                        <p>
                            I've faced challenges in the past, but my passion for tech have sustaind me</p>
